# AI-Project
This repository contains an Artificial Intelligence (AI) project implemented for an introductory course to AI at the German University in Cairo (GUC).

Having an Ironman theme, the aim of this project is to formulate a search plan that Iron Man can follow to defeat Thanos (if
one exists). The following search algorithms are implemented in this project:
a) Breadth-first search.  
b) Depth-first search.  
c) Iterative deepening search.  
d) Uniform-cost search.  
e) Greedy search with two heuristics.  
f) A* search with two admissible heuristics.
